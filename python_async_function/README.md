# Asynchronous Programming in Python

This project explores the asynchronous programming capabilities of Python, utilizing the `asyncio` library and the `random` module to demonstrate various asynchronous operations.

## Concepts Covered

- `async` and `await` syntax in Python for asynchronous execution.
- Execution of asynchronous programs using `asyncio`.
- Running concurrent coroutines with `asyncio`.
- Creation and management of `asyncio` tasks.
- Usage of the `random` module for generating random numbers.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, learners should be able to:

- Understand and apply `async` and `await` syntax in Python.
- Execute asynchronous programs effectively using `asyncio`.
- Manage and run concurrent coroutines.
- Create and handle `asyncio` tasks.
- Utilize the `random` module to introduce randomness into asynchronous programs.

## Requirements

- All scripts must be executable and follow the Python `pycodestyle` guidelines.
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
- Each module and function must include documentation.

## Files and Tasks

- `0-basic_async_syntax.py`: Implements a basic asynchronous coroutine.
- `1-concurrent_coroutines.py`: Runs multiple coroutines concurrently.
- `2-measure_runtime.py`: Measures the runtime of asynchronous operations.
- `3-tasks.py`: Demonstrates the creation of `asyncio` tasks.
- `4-tasks.py`: Expands on task creation with multiple concurrent tasks.
